## Running Nextflow with nf-core Pipelines on TUoS Stanage Cluster

This guide describes the main steps required for setting up Nextflow and nf-core on TUoS Stanage Cluster.

The simplest solution to running Nextflow and nfcore pipelines on Stanage while ensuring all dependencies are available and correctly managed is to install Nextflow and nf-core into a Conda environment using a personal install of miniconda. These processes are described as part of this guide.
