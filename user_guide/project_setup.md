# Setup your Project and Configure your Run

The Sheffield Bioinformatics Core suggest that you run all of your projects from the `parscratch` file store but you may choose to run them from elsewhere.

Whichever file store you decide to locate your project root directory in, the assumed project sub-directory structure within this guide is as follows:

```
/filestore/$USER/
│
└── project_root/
    │
    ├── config
    ├── params
    ├── sample_sheet
    └── script
```

This directory tree can be established by running the command shown below. Please ensuring that you change `filestore` to the actual name of the filestore you wish to locate your project within e.g., `parscratch` and that you change `project_root` to the name of the project e.g., `2023_01_01_demo_project`

```bash
# setup project directory structure
mkdir -p /filestore/$USER/project_root/{config,params,sample_sheet,script}
```

Many nf-core pipelines require a sample sheet detailing the files you wish to analyse. You can find nf-core pipelines by visiting [https://nf-co.re/pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines). Each pipeline page has more information on how to use the pipeline as well as a full description of sample sheet requirements and formatting.

Your sample sheet should be located inside your `sample_sheet` sub-directory.

There are two other things you will require to run an nf-core pipeline:

1. A pipeline launcher parameter configuration file
2. A submission script

The general launch command in the script template provided here assumes you have configured your specific run using an nf-core pipeline launcher. For example, the launcher for the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline that can be found [here](https://nf-co.re/launch?pipeline=rnaseq). The parameters specified for your run using the launcher should be saved in a file named `nf-params.json` within the `params` sub-directory.

To create your run script, navigate to the `script` sub-directory and run the following:

```shell
nano nf_submission.sh
```

Paste the contents of the template file linked below into the editor ensuring to change the generic information for your own where indicated in the comment lines.

[Template run submission script](../templates/script/run_script_template.sh)

Now save and exit by typing "Ctrl + O" then "Return" then "Ctrl + X".
