# Submitting a Pipeline to the Scheduler on Stanage

Once you have fulfilled all of the requirements in the earlier steps in this guide, you should be ready to submit your batch job to the SLURM scheduler on Stanage. From the project root, type the following:

```bash
sbatch ./scripts/nf_submission.sh
```
Your pipeline run should start momentarily. Good Luck!
